# Task Manager with User Authentication

## Overview
This is a Django-based web application for managing tasks, with user authentication included. Each user can register, log in, and manage their own personal tasks, including creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. The project is a simple introduction to handling CRUD operations along with Django’s built-in authentication system.

## Features
- User registration and login system.
- Logged-in users can:
  - Create new tasks.
  - View their task list.
  - Edit or update tasks.
  - Delete tasks.
- Tasks are private to each user; users can only see and manage their own tasks.

## Tech Stack
